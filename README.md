# Portfolio
Python portfolio simulation
This Python script simulates the growth of a portfolio's capital over a specified number of years. It incorporates random annual growth rates to provide a realistic representation of how an investment portfolio might perform over time.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```
## Usage

Clone this repository or download the script to your local machine.

Open the script in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).

Customize the following user-defined values at the beginning of the script to match your preferences:

initial_capital: The initial capital you want to invest.
num_years: The number of years for the simulation.
min_growth_rate: The minimum annual growth rate as a decimal (e.g., -0.20 for -20%).
max_growth_rate: The maximum annual growth rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.40 for 40%).
Run the script. It will generate random annual growth rates and simulate portfolio growth.

The script will display the simulation results in both a table and a line chart, showing the capital growth over the specified years.
